MapReduce Assignment

1. Develop a MapReduce job that will split each line of the input text file in to tokens and then
count the occurrences of each unique token. The input text file should be available on the HDFS.
The output will be in the form of:
Hadoop 5
Hotspot 2

text file should be available on HDFS. The output will be in the form of:
2014   -1
2015 20

3. Develop a MapReduce job that will split each line of the input text file in to tokens and then find
the average count of all the tokens in the input file. The input text file should be available on the
HDFS. The output will be in the form of:
Hadoop 5
Hotspot 2
AverageCount = 3.5

4. Develop a MapReduce job that will take text file input and will produce the output:
(1) Count of the total token having length greater than or equal to four characters.
Total count for token = 5

5. Develop a MapReduce job that will count the total number of females voters in the record file
